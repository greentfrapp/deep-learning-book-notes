# 20 Deep Generative Models

> The Boltzmann machine is an energy-based model [...]

Recall energy-based models introduced in Chapter 16 (16.2.4). We typically try to minimize the energy of a model ie. maximize its probability.

`page 646` Equation 20.3 is an expanded form of Equation 20.2.

> "fire together, wire together"

This is a phrase coined by Donald Hebb, a Canadian neuropsychologist, meant to describe a possible way for neurons to learn - connections between two neurons will strengthen if they both fire at the same time.

> Proposals for biologically plausible implementations (and approximations) of backpropagation have been made (Hinton, 2007a; Bengio, 2015) but remain to be validated [...]

Some recent works on biologically plausible backpropagation include works such as Feedback Alignment by Lillicrap et al. ([2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13276)) and other works including NÃ¸kland ([2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01596)) and Bengio et al. ([2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04156)).
