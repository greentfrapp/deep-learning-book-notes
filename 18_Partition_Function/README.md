# 18 Confronting the Partition Function

`page 598` Referencing the LISA Lab [tutorial](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/rbm.html) on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs):

> The terms positive and negative do not refer to the sign of each term in the equation, but rather reflect their effect on the probability density defined by the model. The [positive phase] increases the probability of training data (by reducing the corresponding free energy), while the [negative phase] decreases the probability of samples generated by the model.

This is also mentioned in page 599, in the last two paragraphs before Section 18.2 and subsequently in page 601, from Figure 18.1.

> For models that guarantee ![p(\mathbf{x})>0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p%28%5Cmathbf%7Bx%7D%29%3E0) for all ![\mathbf{x}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathbf%7Bx%7D) [...]

Such as energy-based models (EBMs) introduced in previous chapters!

`page 599` Leibniz's integral rule in Equation 18.14 can be used to replace the transition from Equation 18.7 to 18.8 for continuous data.
