# deep-learning-book-notes

A record of my notes as I go through the [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) textbook.

A bit of context: Been dabbling in AI research but largely self-taught so far, without any formal computer science background. Mostly picking up things as and when I needed them but have always felt the need to fix my foundations so here's an attempt at that. With that in mind, my goal here is to go through the entire book from start to end, including the foundational math chapters at the beginning.

Unlike the [Reinforcement Learning](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) textbook (Sutton & Barto), the Deep Learning textbook does not contain any exercises. Instead, I will attempt to implement the algorithms in Python code when appropriate.

The annotations are made with reference to the hard copy of the book, which does not correspond to the web version. I will update all the pages when I finish the annotations.
