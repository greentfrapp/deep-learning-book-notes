# 1 Introduction

`page 2` Cyc's story (Linde, 1992) of not recognizing "FredWhileShaving" as a person is used to illustrate a pitfall of the knowledge-base approach to AI. The nature of the mistake is not explicitly described, probably because it seems too ludicrous a mistake and it fits the caricature of dumb inflexible robots in movies. But is it truly a pitfall? Consider prevalent debates on the humanity of cyborgs. Could it be that Cyc's concern here is not mistaken but merely premature? Furthermore, are today's algorithms any better? With reference to Gary Marcus's [essay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00631) and numerous papers on adversarial attacks, today's deep learning feels equally brittle, while being less understandable.

> AI systems need the ability to acquire their own knowledge

- Although to a certain extent, the algorithms and network architectures impose priors and biases
- Current resurgence in symbolic programming

Page 4 Representation Learning - Interpretation and other problems?

Page 13 "intended to be computational models of biological learning" See Hinton's paper on biologically plausible mechanisms and the NIPS paper on Direct Feedback. Also some comments on the energy efficiency and size of the brain relative to its memory and processing power

Page 14 Interesting weight update algorithms eg. WINNOW

Page 15 First paragraph on monitoring neurons - see Google Brain's research on neuron mapping

Page 15 ReLU - note to self: understand more about differences between sigmoid, tanh, relu, leaky relu etc. - later in Chapter 6? Also see paper from Google Brain on searching for activation function

Page 16 Distributed representation - Interesting, never really thought about it this way. It seems extremely nonintuitive to encode the first example (9 combinations) although that might be a bias due to my exposure to present-day deep learning. How does this relate to current deep learning systems?

Think about demonstration of transferring RL from simulation to real robotics using RPi or Arduino
