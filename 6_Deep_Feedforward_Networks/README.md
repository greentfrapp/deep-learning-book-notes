# 6 Deep Feedforward Networks

> Deep feedforward networks, also called feedforward neural networks, or multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) [...]

Feedforward networks go by many names, but they all refer to the same notion of nested functions, where each function is a linear transformation of the input and optionally followed by a nonlinear activation function. 

Common names include: 

- Deep Feedforward Networks (DFN)
- Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
- Feedforward Networks (FFN)
- Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)
- Fully Connected Networks (FCN)
- Dense Networks
